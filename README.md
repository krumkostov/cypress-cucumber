## Notes on the Implementation of the Project

I encountered some issues while setting up your sample project, possibly due to differences in Cypress and Node.js versions. For my project, I used the following software versions:

- **Cypress version**: v13.16.0
- **Node.js version**: v20.18.1
- **npm version**: 10.8.2

Unfortunately, I had another interview assignment to complete by the end of last week. However, yesterday and today, I managed to complete all test cases except for 5 and 8. I structured the project using the **Page Object Model (POM)**.

Additionally, I documented one bug as an example to demonstrate how I typically describe issues.

If you find my work satisfactory, I would be happy to discuss further opportunities.
